# NeuralNetworksForTheUninitiated


A step by step guide for Neural Networks. This version is still a work in progress.


This directory should include:
    dir
     |  
     |-> BackPropagationNN.pdf     A guide explaining the mathematics behind the code.  
     |  
     |-> BackForwardNN.py          A python implementation of the Neural Network.  
     |  
     |-> input.mat                 A matlab file containing sampel input to the NN.  
     |  
     |-> w_gredients.mat           Output of the program.  
     |  
     |-> b_gredients.mat           Output of the program.
